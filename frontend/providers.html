            <h3>Money Mart Settlement Webinar</h3>
            <p>
                On July 2012, City Attorney Dennis Herrera launched a three-month statewide outreach effort to refund up to $7.5 million to California consumers who obtained short-term installment loans from Money Mart and Loan Mart. Consumers may be eligible for repayments in amounts ranging from $20 to $1,800. The SF City Attorney’s Office and SF Office of Financial Empowerment hosted a webinar detailing who is eligible to make a claim for repayment and outlining strategies your organization or city can take to help Californians who took out these loans.

            <h3>The Life Cycle of Debt</h3>
            <p>
                Many consumers find themselves trapped in a cycle of debt and don’t know what options exist or what resources they can trust to get back on track. This workshop covers options for individuals with high debt, rights of individuals who find themselves in collections, and how individuals can begin to re-establish their credit after financial set backs.

            <h3>Direct Deposit & CurrenC SF:The Best Way to Get Paid</h3>
            <p>
                CurrenC SF is a new initiative dedicated to extending the benefits of direct deposit to every working San Franciscan.

                What if one little change could protect your money, free up your time, and clean up the environment? That’s direct deposit: a safer, smarter, easier, and greener way to get paid. If you are getting paid by paper paycheck, you are risking loss, theft, or fraud. With direct deposit, you save money, avoiding check cashers and eliminate monthly checking account fees. Your money is safe, and available immediately on payday – on time, every time.
